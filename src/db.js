This diet has remained unchanged throughout the course of evolution. Wolfie grain-free dog food is based on these eating habits and will appeal to your dog's natural instincts. The wholesome wet food is similar to the wolf's natural diet. It is well accepted, easy to digest and provides your pet with a balanced nutrient uptake. Wolfie wet dog food contains at least 66% pure meat. This is the sole source of animal protein and also provides your pet with essential fatty acids as well. The only other ingredients are fruits of the forest (mixed berries), wild herbs and roots. Cranberries, blackberries, blueberries or raspberries, together with dandelion roots and wild herbs such as nettle leaves, common yarrow and dandelion root, provide important minerals as well as secondary plant matter. The premium quality ingredients provide your trusty pet with a tasty, natural meal and you can be sure that you are feeding your dog with a species appropriate diet. This delicious wet food is well accepted and suitable for dogs with nutritional sensitivities."

Toxins and protein wastes are not eliminated properly, and the kidneys become overloaded. If your dog is suffering from kidney disease it needs a diet that relieves and supports the kidneys. Insufficient or low fluid intake combined with an acidic urinary environment can lead to the formation of bladder stones such as calcium oxalate or uric acid stones. The appropriate mineral content and urinary pH values can help to reduce the risk of bladder stones."

The modern, tame cat that is a member of your family has evolved from the wild cat, and even though it has been domesticated for thousands of years, it still retains the predator instincts of its ancestors. Domesticated cats are obligate carnivores, in other words they need to eat meat to survive so it is important to give them a diet with lots of healthy, protein-rich meat which provides them with all the nutrients they need to stay healthy. This premium wet food is made with lots of healthy meat including lean muscle meat. The total meat content comes to 98%. And since cats do not eat grain in the wild this cat food is completely grain-free."
